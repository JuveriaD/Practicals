        Fastrack was launched in 1998 and became an independent urban youth brand in 2005. Since then, it has carved a niche for itself with watches and sunglasses that are both fashionable and affordable. Fastrack extended its footprint into accessories in 2009
        with a range of bags, belts and wallets.

        unique & affordable designs & its quick extension across categories ensures its popularity with the urban youth audience, making it one of the fastest growing fashion brands within the country. Its growing presence on Facebook – a fan base that
        now has a followership of 9 million, keeps it in touch with its audience.
